# 0-1 Knapsack Problem

### 6 sub problems
1) Subset Sum
2) Equal Sum
3) Count of Subset Sum
4) Minimum Subset sum difference
5) Target Sum
6) Number of subset with given difference
 

### Types of Knapsack Problem:
1) Fractional Knapsack -> greedy Algorithm
2) 0-1 Knapsack -> DP
3) unbounded knapsack -> DP


## 0-1 Knapsack problem :
You are given a bag with capacity W. You need to fill the bag with items such that you get maximum profit. Given N items with weight w and cost c.


## Subset Sum Problem :
You are given an array of size n. Find whether there is a subset whose sum is equal to given sum.

## Equal Sum Partition :
You are given an array of size n. find whether given array can be partitioned into two parts such that sum of both partition is equal.

## Count of Subset Sum :
You are given an array of size n. Count the number of subset whose sum is equal to given sum.

## Minimum Subset Sum Difference:
You are given an array of size n. Partition given array into two subset set such that difference of the sum of both the subset is minimum.

## Number of Subset with given difference
You are given an array of size n. Partition given array into two subset such that difference of the sum of both the subset is equal to given value.

## Target Sum
You are given an array of size n. Count the number of ways to put sign '+' or '-' on each number such that sum is equal to given sum.
